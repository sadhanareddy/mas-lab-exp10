Click on the computer monitor to open the scan page.Run the scan in the kinetics mode by clicking on the ‘Scan’ button and observe the scan. In the real spectrophotometer, an appropriate wavelength of light is selected (here lambda_=520 nm) at which increase in absorbance vs. time scan is performed by using the accompanied computer software. When the scan is complete click on the ‘Next’ tab for beginning the kinetic measurements of Sample 2 and Sample 3.
