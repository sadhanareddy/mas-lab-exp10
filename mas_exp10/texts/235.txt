Run the wavelength scan by clicking on the Computer monitor and then on the Scan button and observe the scan. In the real spectrophotometer, an appropriate wavelength range of incident light for the sample can be chosen and the wavelength scan are run via the accompanied computer software. One can run the scan in absorbance or transmittance mode. The scan data is stored in the computer. If the spectrophotometer is a single beam instrument, then first the sample blank or reference is taken in a cuvette and the wavelength scan is run followed by the sample. One has to subtract the reference data from the sample data for respective wavelengths. Collect data by clicking on the Data tab. Plot the absorbance (and transmittance) of the sample at various wavelengths and determine the wavelength of maximum absorption i.e., spectral peak-position. Colloidal gold particles absorb maximum light near wavelength 520 nm.
