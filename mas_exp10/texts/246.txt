Repeat the above steps and study the developments of Sample 2 and Sample 3 gold particles.Thus one prepares various-sized gold particles depending on the seed particle to Au(III) ion concentration ratio.All the samples left for ~12 hrs before using them as catalysts for eosin reduction. The rate of catalysis was found to be very slow within 3-4 hrs of their preparations.Collect data by clicking on the Data tab. Plot the absorbance vs. time for the sample.What is the nature of the plot: sigmoidal?Attempt an autocatalytic fit of the data.
